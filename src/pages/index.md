    content: "## You have questions. &#xA;Luckily, we have answers.\n\n#### What is this ?\n\nHappyMailer is a tool that allows you to simply send letters within Canada. You can now mail people without needing to look around for stamps, envelopes and some *oh-so-expensive* printer ink. We take care of all that for you.\n\n#### How does that work ?\n\nJust upload PDFs of your choice, and write the address of your recipient (again, only in Canada at the moment). We will then print your document, put it in a letter and send it either the same day, or the very next day if not possible.\n\n#### Can I send letters outside of Canada ?\n\n\U0001F643Not at the moment, sorry about that !\n\n#### What will my letter look like ?\n\nA regular letter, identical to the PDF you upload. There will not be any specific markings on the envelope.\n\n#### What about data safety ?\n\nWe will never read any of your mail and all letters will be deleted after 3 months from our servers.\nPlease note however that HappyMailer is not intended to be used for confidential content, but only for mail without any sensible information.\n\n#### When will my letter arrive ?\n\nAt the moment, we do not offer tracking. The letter will be sent from Montreal via the regular route of Canada Post, which will take around :\n\n*   2 business days within a city\n\n*   3 business days within a province\n\n*   4 business days nationally (excluding the day of mailing)\n\n"
