## You have questions. Luckily, we have answers.

#### What is this ?

HappyMailer is a tool that allows you to simply send letters within Canada. You can now mail people without needing to look around for stamps, envelopes and someÂ *oh-so-expensive*Â printer ink. We take care of all that for you.

#### How does that work ?

Just upload PDFs of your choice, and write the address of your recipient (again, only in Canada at the moment). We will then print your document, put it in a letter and send it either the same day, or the very next day if not possible.

#### Can I send letters outside of Canada ?

ðŸ™ƒNot at the moment, sorry about that !

#### What will my letter look like ?

A regular letter, identical to the PDF you upload. There will not be any specific markings on the envelope (except the address, obviously)

#### Can I track my mail ?

At the moment, we do not offer tracking. Sorry !

#### What about data safety ?

We will never read any of your mail and all letters will be deleted after 1 month from our servers. Please note however that HappyMailer is not intended to be used for confidential content, but only for mail without any sensible information.

#### When will my letter arrive ?

The letter will be sent from Montreal via the regular route of Canada Post, which will take around :

*   2 business days within a city

*   3 business days within a province

*   4 business days nationally (excluding the day of mailing)
